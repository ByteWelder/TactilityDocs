# Installation

## IDE

An IDE is optional. You can build everything with CMake via the commandline.

Here are some good IDE options:
- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) (paid)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (free)

## External App Development

The setup for external app development is very minimal. You only need a project [like this](https://github.com/ByteWelder/Tactility/tree/main/ExternalApps/HelloWorld).

## Firmware Development

For firmware development, you need to check out the [git repository](https://github.com/ByteWelder/Tactility).

Make sure to use the `--recurse-submodules` parameter.
