# Create An External App

[App Fundamentals](app-fundamentals.md) will teach you the basics.

An example app can be found in the main repository in the [ExternalApps](https://github.com/ByteWelder/Tactility/tree/main/ExternalApps) folder. Make a copy and use it as a template to build your own.

Run `python tactility.py build all` to build all variants. Documentation for this command can be found [here](https://github.com/ByteWelder/TactilityTool).
Or run `python tactility.py --help` to show the commandline options.
